# WORK IN PROGRESS

Tracker for Fantasy Premier League. Create teams for both you and your opponents which allows you to see live team points during games.
The official FPL app and site currently only updates total scores once games are finished, which can be frustrating for those who want to
know how matchups are progressing during a live game.
